## Status: ✅ Success

## Analysis Plan
**Intents:** 12
**Rationale:** The analysis plan is designed to address the key research objectives outlined in the project scope. The intents focus on understanding overall satisfaction, segment differences, feature usage, and retention risks. High priority is given to analyses that directly inform product improvement and customer retention strategies. Suggested segments are based on demographic and usage characteristics that are likely to reveal meaningful patterns.
