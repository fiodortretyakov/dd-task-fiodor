# Product Satisfaction Survey - Project Scope

## Background

We recently launched version 2.0 of our SaaS analytics platform and want to understand customer satisfaction levels across different segments. This survey was conducted with 60 customers across various demographics and subscription tiers.

## Research Objectives

1. **Overall Satisfaction Assessment**
   - Understand the overall NPS score and satisfaction levels
   - Identify key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction

2. **Segment Analysis**
   - Compare satisfaction across different customer segments (plan type, tenure, region)
   - Identify underperforming segments that need attention

3. **Feature Usage Analysis**
   - Understand which features are most commonly used
   - Correlate feature usage with satisfaction levels

4. **Retention Risk Assessment**
   - Identify customers at risk of churn (low NPS, low purchase intent)
   - Understand what factors contribute to retention risk

## Key Questions to Answer

- What is our overall NPS and how does it break down by region?
- Are enterprise customers more satisfied than free/basic users?
- Which features drive the highest satisfaction?
- Is there a correlation between usage frequency and satisfaction?
- What is the satisfaction profile of long-term vs new customers?
- Are there any demographic patterns in satisfaction levels?

## Success Metrics

- NPS > 50 is considered good
- Top 2 Box satisfaction > 70% is the target
- Aim to identify at least 3 actionable insights for product improvement

## Timeline

Analysis should be completed within 1 week to inform the Q1 product roadmap.
